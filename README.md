# Pacman
The Pac-Man game uses various data structures to manage its elements effectively. The maze is represented as a 2D array, characters like Pac-Man and ghosts are objects with properties, and items such as dots and power pellets are stored in lists. Pathfinding for ghosts can be handled using graphs, and high scores are maintained in a hash map. This approach ensures efficient management of game elements for smooth gameplay.
